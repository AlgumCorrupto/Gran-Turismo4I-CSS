<h1>Gran Turismo 4 CSS</h1>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>I have made this for an upcoming project, and i've thoght that this would be a cool thing to share for the frutiger aero/AquaUI enthusiasts out there</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>I've made this stylesheet using SCSS using the <a href="https://blog.logrocket.com/the-definitive-guide-to-scss"/> this guide as a reference </a>. You can monitor <code>./source/index.scss</code> 
using <code>sass --watch source/index.scss build/index.css</code> or just yoink the index.css file inside the build directory, also i've worked on some custom elements like, the custom tab element, that can be found inside <code>source/scripts/</code> directory
